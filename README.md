# Topic Benchmarks

A collection of smallish **benchmark exercises** focused on key topics in web development.

These topics are sourced from the [Skills Matrix](http://matrix.apps.learnersguild.org/).

This is the base repo for the Topic Benchmarks (TODO: add link) goal.

## Getting Started

If you are doing the Topic Benchmarks goal, then you'll be doing all of your work in a fork of this repo.

The benchmark exercises are organized into topic directories. Each one should take you roughly 1 day assuming the topic is within your ZPD. If it takes more than a day, you may want to try an easier one.

1. Fork this repo
2. Pick a topic benchmark to work on
3. Read the appropriate `README.md` and follow instructions within
4. Complete the benchmark as well as you can
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the week is over
